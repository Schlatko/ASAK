  "sub3": "Injection moulds can be classified according to the injection method, i.e. the way in which the molten plastic material is introduced into the mould. There are essentially two main types of injection methods.",
  "header4": "Undercuts",
  "sub4": "The production of undercuts in injection moulding requires special techniques and mechanisms, as they indicate areas in a moulded part that cannot be separated by simply pushing the two halves of the mould apart. Undercuts can be caused by overhanging structures or internal features, for example.",

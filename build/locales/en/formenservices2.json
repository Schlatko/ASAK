      "text2": "Aluminium is lighter and conducts heat more efficiently than steel. Aluminium moulds are therefore particularly suitable when fast cycle times are required, for example for prototypes or smaller production runs. However, they are not suitable for large quantities, as aluminium is less wear-resistant than steel."
